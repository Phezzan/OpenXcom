This is a summary of planned and completed changes to OpenXcom rulesets for Phezzan's mod.
Some of these rule changes require code changes from Phezzan's game.
Others are just personal preference etc...

This file is intended to be read in VIM.

Planned		::
	Items::
		Adv MediKit		More effective with More doses
		Plasma Torch	Melee 'weapon' for cutting UFO hulls.
		Sniper Laser	Hvy Laser with only "Aimed" shots, has Armor_Piercing
		Mind Probe		There should be a human version - perhaps like the Motion Scanner
		Fusion Gren		An Advanced Prox Grenade
		Fusion HiEx		A directed charge for breaching UFOs.
		Tactical Armor	Palette shifted personal - 20% better, but heavy.
		Adv Ballistics	Dredd's gun.
	;;
	No Category::
		NightVision		Extend XCom Night Vision from 18 to 20. Possibly suppress reaction for wearer?
		poison			New Damage Type - adds Dmg over Time to target
		FleshWound		Use Armor_Piercing values to reduce damage to non-Insta-Kill levels. (I've had worse)

	;;

Completed		::
	Items::

		Adv Tank			Good for mid game vs Plasma Rifles
	;;
