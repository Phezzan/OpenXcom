This is a summary of Phezzan's planned and completed OpenXcom code changes.
This file is intended to be read in VIM.

Planned		::
	Items::
		NightVision		Extend XCom Night Vision from 18 to 20. Possibly suppress reaction for wearer?
	;;
	GUI::
		Inventory		Drop should be one click - Pick up to Right Hand / Belt also one click

	;;
	Tweaks::
		poison			New Damage Type - adds Dmg over Time to target
		Regeneration	New Unit rule variable and BattleUnit variable - heals per turn.
		Armor_Piercing	Partially ignore armor thresholds: Brilliant Energy
		Armor_Rending	Damages Armor directly. -1 could prevent normal armor dmg 
							Acid / Psi Claws?
		STR_Enhance		Power Armor adds a bonus to STR
		Slow_Heal		Health is not instant - heal() -> 'Heal counter' which operates at NewTurn.
		Bravery			Make it a normal stat
		Experience		Bravery should gain more if it's terrifying than if its just scary.
		Health			increase with wounding, have a higher limit.
	;;

Completed		::
	Items::
		Adv MediKit		More effective with More doses
		Pulse Laser		A Heavy Laser w/ auto fire - req Elerium to build
		;;
	Tweaks::
		Damage 		Normal distribution 
		InstaKill	Nothing should be 'InstaKill', Not Chryssalids, Not HE vs Unconscious
		Difficulty	Everything about Difficulty should ramp:
			Armor		66% -> 120% with 'Veteran' == 100%
			Spawns	No jumps at Veteran and SuperHuman
